            <h2>Hi, I'm Sunjo Thomas</h2>
            <p>I am a Level 4 student at the ICT University, currently studying Cybersecurity. Ever since I was young, I’ve had an obsession with securing digital systems and exploring how they can be exploited. This passion grew into a deep fascination with the art of ethical hacking and cyber defense. I love the challenge of securing systems and uncovering vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.</p>

            <p>My academic journey in cybersecurity has equipped me with a solid foundation in network security, cryptography, and ethical hacking. I am constantly learning and growing, aiming to keep up with the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. I believe that good security is all about staying a step ahead, and that's what drives me to keep pushing my limits.</p>

            <p>When I’m not studying, I love experimenting with security tools, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in cybersecurity. Hacking for good is my ultimate goal — whether it's identifying vulnerabilities or educating others about how to stay safe online.</p>
